# Apply Filters to SQL Queries
The goal of this project is to simulate a situation where it is necessary to investigate all potential security issues and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL commands to interchange filters to perform various security-related tasks.

<h2>Summary:</h2>
I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee
machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND,
OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used
LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
